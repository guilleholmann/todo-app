# TODO APP 

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite + React](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).
We've used Vite because it is faster than Create React App. It's easy to configure and get the local environment working.

## Tools
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?hl=es)
- [React Icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons)

## Getting Started Locally
- Clone this repo
- Go to the project directory
- Run: `npm install`
- You need to connect your Firebase configuration to the file `src/firebase-local.jsx`. You have an example in `src/firebase.jsx`.
- `npm run dev`

## Available Scripts


### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173/todo-app/](http://localhost:5173/todo-app/) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Launches the builder and this generates a new  `dist` folder.
Here you can find the compiled version of the project


### `npm run deploy`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

You need to connect/configure your GitHub page to deploy this. [Read More](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html)
